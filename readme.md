# CS50â€™s Introduction to Artificial Intelligence with Python
# Project 6: Language: Questions

**Aim**: Write an AI to answer questions.

**Description**: Question Answering (QA) is a field within natural language processing focused on designing systems that can answer questions. In this problem, we design a very simple question answering system based on inverse document frequency (tf-idf). *nltk* functions are used for tokenization and stopwords removal.

Our question answering system will perform two tasks: document retrieval and passage retrieval. Our system will have access to a corpus of text documents. When presented with a query (a question in English asked by the user), document retrieval will first identify which document(s) are most relevant to the query. Once the top documents are found, the top document(s) will be subdivided into passages (in this case, sentences) so that the most relevant passage to the question can be determined.
